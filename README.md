# My First Online Portfolio

## Introduction

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

In this challenge, I am going to make a personal portfolio using all the knowledge gained in the last weeks, this includes flexbox, Responsive Web Design, Root and Hover effect, goal for this portfolio is to write as less code as possible and use an external library, in this case, Boostrap. 


I was given a precise layout to follow but it had to include: 
- NavBar
- Hero section that gives a brief introduction to the portfolio
- My work
- Skills I have acquired and/or I'm planning to master by the end of my bootcamp
- About me 
- Contact me

The website must check these criteria:
- Having a clear folder structure that sub contains a folder for CSS and a folder for Images
- Use of Bootstrap for the layout above mentioned
- All button and hyperlinks should have an hover effect
- The final code should minimize the use of media queries

## Description

I have started by creating a plan to follow which allowed me to follow a clear path and not try to do "some here some there". 
The plan was the following:
- Wireframe Model
- Rough HTML
	- Add a NavBar from Bootstrap
	- Add a Jumbotron for the hero section from Bootstrap
	- Add cards from Bootstrap (using image placeholder)
	- Add another Jumbotron for About me from Bootstrap
- Rough CSS
	- Root for different colors
	- Use flex to organize each element
	- Use padding and margin to help organize each element
- Cleaned and fixed remaining HTML Code (Adding text and adding pictures)
- Cleaned and fixed remaining CSS code (added hover effects for buttons and contact me icons)
- Responsive design at different width to have a good and clear UI.
- Commented
- Pushed code and deploy webpage on GitHub

For hover effects, all button and icons had a increasing size transition and a time was specified to create a smooth transition, all button had included also a shadow effect effect. 

A JS section was added that would change the palette of the page, from a light to a dark theme.

## Final Results at different screen sizes

![Full Width](/images/ReadMeImages/fullscreen.png)
This webpage has some responsiveness:
### "My Skill" and "About Me" section changes at 875px

This was done if there were to column the text would have looked too compact and difficult to read, organizing each block left and right helped giving some styling and helped ease reading the text.
This was also for the About Me section, the photo profile was moved on top as the text otherwise would have been too tight and, it looks as well as there is a better use of page space at under that width.

### "My Skill" section changes at 550px:

In addition to making the website more responsive, two different hover effects were added, both increasing the size of the element clicked and in addition, button had shadow effects as well.
